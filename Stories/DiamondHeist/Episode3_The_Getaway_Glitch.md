# Episode 3: The Getaway Glitch

**Perspective:** Diamond's POV  
**Setting:** The Penthouse Roof & The High-Speed Elevator

---

## Characters

- **Diamond:** High adrenaline, hair slightly messy, switching from "innocent victim" to "mastermind" rapidly.
- **King Pimpin' (On Screens):** Watching the feeds, getting frustrated but intrigued.
- **Yago (The Digital Sidekick):** Represented as a holographic avatar (maybe a little robot or a stylized street character) floating on the screens. He is the "Snitch."

## PAGE 1: Enter Yago

### Panel 1 (Page 1)

**Visual:** The room is flashing red. Diamond is running toward the elevator. King Pimpin's face is still on the giant wall screen. Next to him, a smaller, glitchy avatar appears—this is Yago.

**Yago (Digital Font):** "Yo Boss! Security breach in Sector 4. Shorty is trying to hit the elevator! Should I drop the lockdown gates?"

### Panel 2 (Page 1)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' leans back in his chair, lighting a cigar. He looks cool, unbothered.

**King Pimpin':** "Nah, Yago. Let her run. I wanna see how she handles the pressure. Activate the Bonus Round protocols."

### Panel 3 (Page 1)

**Visual:** Diamond slams her hand on the elevator button. Nothing happens. She looks at the security camera, batting her eyelashes, trying the "soft" approach one last time.

**Diamond (Sweet/Panicked Voice):** "Mr. Pimpin'! Your elevator is broken! I'm just a scared girl trying to get home to her bible study!"

### Panel 4 (Page 1)

**Visual:** The elevator doors ping open, but there is no elevator car—just an empty shaft and cables. Yago's avatar appears on the little screen next to the buttons, laughing.

**Yago:** "Bible study? Yeah right! You ain't prayin', you payin'! Elevator's out of service, mama!"

## PAGE 2: The Shaft (Action Sequence)

### Panel 1 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Diamond drops the act instantly. Her face goes hard. She looks down the empty black shaft.

**Diamond (Street Voice):** "Alright, you digital little snitch. We'll do it the hard way."

### Panel 2 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Diamond jumps into the empty shaft. She isn't falling; she is sliding down the grease-covered cables using the torn fabric of her dress to protect her hands.

**SFX:** ZZZZZZZZIP!

### Panel 3 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Inside the Control Room. King Pimpin' stands up, eyes wide. He is shocked.

**King Pimpin':** "Did she just jump? With no harness?"

### Panel 4 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Yago looks worried.

**Yago:** "Boss! Calculated survival odds are low! She's crazy! She's gonna mess up the paint on the ground floor!"

**King Pimpin':** "Quiet, Yago. Look at her form. She ain't crazy... she's fearless."

## PAGE 3: The Garage Trap

### Panel 1 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Diamond lands in the underground garage (superhero landing style). She is surrounded by luxury cars (lowriders, exotics). The garage door is closing fast.

### Panel 2 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Diamond sprints toward a custom purple convertible. Yago's face appears on the car's dashboard screen.

**Yago:** "Uh uh uh! Ignition disabled! You ain't hot-wiring my ride, thief!"

### Panel 3 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Diamond rips the dashboard panel open. She isn't hot-wiring it; she is plugging her phone directly into the port.

**Diamond (Witty):** "I'm not hot-wiring, Yago. I'm jailbreaking. You might be a smart AI, but you're running on old software."

**Computer Text:** System Override. Admin Access Granted.

### Panel 4 (Page 3)

**Visual:** The engine roars to life. Blue flames shoot out the exhaust. Yago's avatar on the screen looks dizzy/glitched out (X_X eyes).

**Yago:** "Err_0r... SysTem... CRaaSh..."

---

## PAGE 4: The Turn (The Attraction)

### Panel 1 (Page 4)

**Visual:** The purple convertible drifts around the corner, screeching tires, sliding under the closing garage door just before it hits the ground. Sparks fly.

### Panel 2 (Page 4)

**Visual:** Inside the Control Room. King Pimpin' is no longer sitting. He is standing right at the main screen, watching the tail lights fade into the city distance.

### Panel 3 (Page 4)

**Visual:** Close up on King Pimpin's face. He isn't angry about the diamond. He is smiling. A genuine, impressed smile. He bites his lip slightly.

**King Pimpin':** "She hacked Yago... she slid down a 40-story shaft... and she stole my favorite whip."

### Panel 4 (Page 4)

**Visual:** He turns to walk out of the room, grabbing his coat. Yago (rebooting) speaks up.

**Yago:** "Boss? Should I call the cops?"

**King Pimpin':** "Cops? Hell no. Cops can't handle a woman like that."

### Panel 5 (Page 4)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' putting on his sunglasses.

**King Pimpin':** "I'm gonna handle this one myself. Prepare the jet. The game just started."

**Caption:** END OF DIAMOND'S TALE. Next Issue: KING PIMPIN'S SIDE OF THE STORY (The Truth Behind the Trap).

## Why This Works for Your Plan

- **Yago as the Bonus:** We see Yago fail here (getting hacked). This makes the reader want to buy the "Yago Bonus Story" later to see how Yago redeems himself or explains the glitch.
- **The Attraction:** We clearly show Pimpin' falling for her because of her skills, not just her looks.
- **The Tension:** It ends with her escaping, but him coming after her.
- **The Cliffhanger:** We don't know where she is going or if he catches her.
