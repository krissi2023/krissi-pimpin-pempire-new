## PAGE 1: The Scouting Report

### Panel 1
**Visual:** POV shot through King Pimpin's sunglasses. The party is overlaid with digital data. Guests have red "LOW THREAT" boxes over their heads.

**Yago (Voice in ear):** "Scanning perimeter, Boss. Just a bunch of politicians and investors. No threats detected. Boredom levels critical."

### Panel 2
**Visual:** The scanner locks onto Diamond across the room. The target box turns GOLD. Data scrolls rapidly: Heart Rate: Steady. Deception: High. Threat Level: UNKNOWN.

**King Pimpin':** "Hold up, Yago. Rewind. Who is that?"

### Panel 3
**Visual:** King Pimpin' adjusts his cufflinks, staring at her.

**Yago:** "Database search... No ID. She's a ghost, Boss. But her outfit costs more than the security guard's yearly salary. She's here for the rock."

**King Pimpin':** "A ghost in my machine? Alright. Let's go say hello."

### Panel 4
**Visual:** King Pimpin' walks into the crowd. He puts on a fake "Arrogant Rich Guy" smile.

**King Pimpin' (Internal Monologue):** "Game face on. Act dumb. Let her think she's the smartest person in the room."

## PAGE 2: The "Accident" (Revisited)

### Panel 1
**Visual:** Diamond approaches him (same scene as her story). She is looking up at him with big "innocent" eyes.

**Diamond:** "Oh, Mr. King... you must be a genius to understand how it all works."

**King Pimpin' (Spoken):** "Just a hobby, my dear. I like to keep my toys safe."

**King Pimpin' (Internal Monologue):** "Flattery. The oldest trick in the book. She's playing 'The Damsel'. Classy."

### Panel 2
**Visual:** The moment she bumps into him.

**SFX:** BUMP.

**Diamond:** "Oh! I am so clumsy!"

### Panel 3
**Visual:** Close up on King Pimpin's face. He isn't looking at her face; his eyes are darting down to his side.

**King Pimpin' (Internal Monologue):** "Hand in the pocket. Two fingers. Light touch. She just lifted my print. Damn... she's good. Most guys wouldn't have even felt that."

### Panel 4
**Visual:** He helps her steady herself, keeping his hand on her arm for a second longer than necessary.

**King Pimpin' (Spoken - Smooth):** "...be careful now. Wouldn't want you to fall before the fun starts."

## PAGE 3: The Counter-Move

### Panel 1
**Visual:** Diamond walks away toward the "bathroom." King Pimpin' watches her go, his smile fading into a focused stare.

**Yago:** "Boss! She stole your thumbprint! Breach imminent! Should I lock down the vault?"

### Panel 2
**Visual:** King Pimpin' looks at his thumb. He wipes it with a handkerchief.

**King Pimpin':** "No lockdown. If she wants to play, let her play."

### Panel 3
**Visual:** King Pimpin' taps a command into his watch.

**King Pimpin':** "Yago, switch the vault security from 'Static' to 'Arcade Mode'. If she uses that thumbprint, it doesn't open the door... it starts the game."

### Panel 4
**Visual:** Yago's avatar appears, looking excited.

**Yago:** "Arcade Mode? You mean the traps? The Fish Table Lasers? The Slot Machine Locks?"

**King Pimpin':** "Everything. Let's see if this 'Ghost' has any real skills, or if she's just a pretty face."

## PAGE 4: The Invitation

### Panel 1
**Visual:** King Pimpin' walks into his private elevator, heading up to the Control Room (where we saw him in Diamond's story).

**King Pimpin':** "I need a challenge, Yago. Business has been too easy lately."

### Panel 2
**Visual:** A split screen. On the left, Diamond is tearing off her dress to reveal her tactical gear. On the right, King Pimpin' is loosening his tie and sitting in his command chair.

**King Pimpin':** "She thinks she's robbing a bank."

### Panel 3
**Visual:** King Pimpin' presses a big glowing button labeled INSERT COIN / START GAME.

**King Pimpin':** "I'm just inviting her to the arcade. Player One has entered the chat."

**Caption:** NOW PLAYING: LEVEL 1.

## Why This Perspective Shift Works
- **Re-Contextualization:** In her story, she thought she tricked him into giving the print. In his story, we learn he allowed the print to work as a "Token" to start the game.
- **Business Promotion:** It explicitly mentions "Arcade Mode" and "Insert Coin," reinforcing your real-life business theme.
- **Character Depth:** It shows he respects her ("Damn... she's good") rather than just being a victim.
- **Setup for Romance:** He initiates the game not because he wants to arrest her, but because he is bored and wants to see if she is his equal.
