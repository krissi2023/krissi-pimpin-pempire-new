## PAGE 1: The Elevator Bluff

### Panel 1 (Page 1)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' watches the elevator feed. Diamond is pleading at the camera ("I'm just a scared girl!"). Yago is vibrating with excitement.

**Yago:** "Look at her! She's folding! She's crying! I told you, Boss! No one beats the Pimpire security! Should I drop the cage?"

### Panel 2 (Page 1)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' zooms in on the screen. He studies her face.

**King Pimpin':** "She ain't crying, Yago. That's crocodile tears. She's stalling for time to check the shaft depth."

### Panel 3 (Page 1)

**Visual:** On screen, Diamond drops the act and jumps into the dark shaft.

**Yago:** "HOLY MOTHERBOARD! She jumped! Calculating impact... wait, she's sliding! She's using the friction!"

### Panel 4 (Page 1)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' stands up slowly, a smirk forming.

**King Pimpin':** "Crazy. Absolutely crazy. I haven't seen a move like that since I ran the streets in '99."

## PAGE 2: The Glitch (Yago vs. Diamond)

### Panel 1 (Page 2)

**Visual:** The feed switches to the Garage. Diamond is running toward the Purple Convertible.

**Yago:** "Oh, hell no! Not the '08 Custom! That's your baby! Don't worry, Boss. I have total control of the ignition. She can't start it."

### Panel 2 (Page 2)

**Visual:** On screen, Diamond plugs her phone into the dash. In the Control Room, Yago's holographic avatar starts to flicker and distort.

**Yago:** "Wait... unauthorized input... she's rewriting my code... Boss? I feel funny..."

### Panel 3 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Yago's avatar completely fragments into pixelated gibberish.

**Yago:** "SysTem... FaiLure... Tell my mOther... I lOve... her..." BZZZT

**SFX:** Power Down Noise

### Panel 4 (Page 2)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' looks at the dead hologram, then back at the screen where the car is roaring to life.

**King Pimpin':** "She didn't just hotwire the car. She hacked my A.I. She turned my own watchdog into a puppy."

## PAGE 3: The Getaway

### Panel 1 (Page 3)

**Visual:** The Purple Convertible drifts under the closing garage door. It scrapes the paint, sparks flying.

**King Pimpin':** "Ouch. That's gonna cost a few grand in bodywork."

### Panel 2 (Page 3)

**Visual:** The car disappears into the city night. The Control Room is silent. The game is "over."

### Panel 3 (Page 3)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' walks over to a glass case on the wall. Inside is a set of golden car keys and a passport. He unlocks the case.

**King Pimpin' (Internal Monologue):** "Most women want my money. Some want my power. She's the first one who just wanted to beat me."

### Panel 4 (Page 3)

**Visual:** He puts on a leather jacket. He looks like an action hero.

**King Pimpin':** "Yago! Reboot! Get the jet fueled up."

## PAGE 4: The Sequel Setup

### Panel 1 (Page 4)

**Visual:** Yago re-appears, looking woozy and bandaged (digitally).

**Yago:** "Reboot complete... Boss, are we calling the Feds? We have her GPS."

### Panel 2 (Page 4)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' walks toward the exit, silhouetted by the city lights.

**King Pimpin':** "Cancel the Feds. This is a private matter."

### Panel 3 (Page 4)

**Visual:** Close up on King Pimpin's face, putting on his shades.

**King Pimpin':** "She thinks she won the game. She just qualified for the Tournament. Let's go get my Queen."

**Caption:** END OF VOL 1. COMING SOON: VOL 2 - THE CHASE.

## Why This Ending Works

### The Romance Hook

"Most women want my money. Some want my power. She's the first one who just wanted to beat me." - This line establishes that he's falling for her intellect and skills, not her looks.

### The Power Dynamic Shift

He calls her "my Queen" - showing respect and claiming her as an equal, not a criminal.

### The Season 2 Setup

"She just qualified for the Tournament" - The heist wasn't the endgame; it was the audition.

### The Cliffhanger

We don't know:

- Where is Diamond going?
- Does she know he's coming?
- What is "The Tournament"?
- Will they team up or fight?
