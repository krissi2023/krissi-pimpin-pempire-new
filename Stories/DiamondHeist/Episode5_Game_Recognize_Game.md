## PAGE 1: The Slot Machine (The Bet)

### Panel 1 (Page 1)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' is sitting in a massive gaming chair. He is holding a bucket of popcorn. On the main screen, we see a live feed of Diamond standing in front of the Slot Machine Door.

**Yago:** "She's at the Jackpot Door, Boss! Odds of her cracking the encryption? 10,000 to 1. She's gonna trigger the trap door!"

### Panel 2 (Page 1)

### Panel 3 (Page 1)

**Visual:** The screen flashes 7-7-7. The "WINNER" lights go off in the control room.

**SFX:** Ding! Ding! Ding!

**Yago:** "WHAT?! She cheated! She used an external jammer! That's a violation of user terms!"

### Panel 4 (Page 1)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' tosses a piece of popcorn into his mouth, grinning.

**King Pimpin':** "It ain't cheating, it's strategy. She skipped the spin and went straight for the payout. I like her style."

## PAGE 2: The Fish Table (The Skill Check)

### Panel 1 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Diamond enters the "Deep Sea" hallway on the screen. King Pimpin' leans forward, grabbing a joystick built into his chair armrest.

### Panel 2 (Page 2)

### Panel 4 (Page 2)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' laughs out loud. He is having the time of his life.

## PAGE 3: The Card Floor (The Bluff)

### Panel 1 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Diamond reaches the Card Floor. She pauses, looking innocent (the scene where she says she "never learned poker").

**Yago:** "Look at her. She's hesitant. She doesn't know the rules. We got her now, Boss. One wrong step and the gas drops."

### Panel 2 (Page 3)

**Visual:** King Pimpin' shakes his head, looking at the biometric readout on his side monitor.

**King Pimpin':** "Look at her heart rate, Yago. 58 beats per minute. She ain't scared. She's bluffing."

### Panel 3 (Page 3)
