## PAGE 1: The Jackpot Door

### Panel 1
**Visual:** Diamond stands before a massive, golden door. There is no keyhole, just three rotating digital reels (like a Slot Machine) built into the steel.

**King Pimpin' (Over Speaker):** "Yo, Shorty. You made it past the lobby? I'm impressed. But this ain't no playground. You gotta pay to play."

### Panel 2
**Visual:** Diamond examines the reels. They are spinning blurry fast. She adjusts her monocle. She looks innocent and confused.

**Diamond (Soft voice):** "Oh my, looks like a game of chance. I've never been very lucky with gambling..."

### Panel 3
**Visual:** Switch to Mischievous Mode. She pulls out a high-tech jamming device that looks like a compact mirror. She smirks.

**Diamond (Street voice):** "...Good thing I don't gamble. I rig the deck."

**SFX:** ZAP!

### Panel 4
**Visual:** The reels stop instantly. 7 - 7 - 7. The door lights up Green and Gold. Money sounds chime.

**SFX:** CHA-CHING!

**King Pimpin' (Over Speaker):** "Okay, okay. You hit the Jackpot. But don't get gassed. That was just the ante."

## PAGE 2: The Deep Sea (Fish Game Reference)

### Panel 1
**Visual:** She enters a long, dark hallway. The floor is made of glass with water underneath. Suddenly, holographic lasers appear, but they aren't straight lines—they are shaped like Sharks and Whales swimming through the air.

**King Pimpin':** "Welcome to the Deep Sea, baby girl. These sharks don't bite... they burn."

### Panel 2
**Visual:** Diamond dodges a "Shark Laser" with a backbend. It singes a piece of her hair.

**Diamond:** "Damn! You trying to fry me, Pimpin'? I thought you liked your ladies looking fly, not extra crispy."

### Panel 3
**Visual:** She sees the pattern. The "Fish" move in a specific arcade pattern.

**Diamond (Internal Monologue):** "He programmed them like the Fish Tables. Big Boss moves slow, little fish move fast. Ignore the little money, aim for the Boss."

### Panel 4
**Visual:** Diamond spots the "King Crab" laser emitter on the ceiling. She throws a diamond-encrusted stiletto heel directly at it.

**Action:** The heel jams the emitter. The holographic fish flicker and vanish.

### Panel 5
**Visual:** She catches her shoe as it falls, puts it back on, and struts forward.

**Diamond:** "Game Over. Next level, please."

## PAGE 3: The Royal Flush (Card Game Reference)

### Panel 1
**Visual:** She reaches the final Antechamber. The floor is a grid of giant playing cards. Some are face up, some are face down.

**King Pimpin':** "Alright, you got skills. I see you. But this floor is pressure sensitive. You step on a Joker, the whole room fills with knockout gas. You gotta walk the Royal Flush."

### Panel 2
**Visual:** Diamond looks at the floor. It's a maze. She puts a finger to her chin, acting the "Soft/Educated" role again for the camera she knows is watching.

**Diamond (Polite voice):** "Mr. Pimpin', this seems unfair. I never learned how to play Poker. I was too busy studying art history."

### Panel 3
**Visual:** Cut to King Pimpin' in his control room (shadowed face). He is leaning forward, watching the screen, intrigued.

**King Pimpin':** "Yeah, right. Stop cappin'. I know a hustler when I see one. Show me what you got."

### Panel 4
**Visual:** Diamond's eyes narrow. She calculates the path. 10 of Hearts -> Jack -> Queen -> King -> Ace. She hops across them gracefully.

**Diamond (Street voice):** "Heart of a lion, Queen of the scene. Watch the Ace take the pot."

## PAGE 4: The Prize & The Twist

### Panel 1
**Visual:** She clears the floor. The final vault door is open. Inside, floating on a magnetic cushion, is The Pimpire Diamond. It's huge, shaped like a crown.

### Panel 2
**Visual:** She grabs the Diamond. She holds it up to the light.

**Diamond:** "Gotcha. Time to cash out."

### Panel 3
**Visual:** Suddenly, the lights cut out. Emergency red lights strobe. A giant screen descends blocking her exit. King Pimpin's face appears on it—huge and high definition. He isn't angry... he's smiling.

### Panel 4
**Visual:** Diamond looks up at the screen, clutching the diamond.

**King Pimpin' (On Screen):** "You got my rock. Respect. But you triggered the silent alarm 10 minutes ago."

### Panel 5
**Visual:** Sirens are heard in the distance (WEE-WOO WEE-WOO).

**King Pimpin':** "I ain't mad though. Game recognize game. But now... you gotta get past me."

**Caption:** TO BE CONTINUED...

## Notes on the "Urban/Thug" Elements
- **The Language:** Used terms like "Gassed" (ego inflated), "Cappin'" (lying), "Shorty," and "Cash out."
- **The Dynamic:** It's a flirtatious rivalry. He isn't trying to kill her; he's testing her. This sets up the romance for Part 3 perfectly.
- **The Games:**
  - **Slots:** Used as the Door Lock
  - **Fish Table:** Used as the Laser Obstacle course
  - **Poker/Cards:** Used as the treacherous floor maze
