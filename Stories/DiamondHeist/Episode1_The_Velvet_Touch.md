## PAGE 1

### Panel 1 (Page 1)

**Visual:** A wide shot of a luxurious penthouse party. People are dressed in
tuxedos and gowns. In the center, Sterling (older, arrogant) is holding a glass
of wine, gesturing to a massive steel vault door. Diamond stands next to him.
She looks stunning but non-threatening—soft curls, a flowing pastel gown, wide
curious eyes.

**Sterling:** "...titanium reinforced alloy. Thermal sensors. Motion
detectors. It is, quite literally, the safest room in the city."

**Diamond (Polite/Sweet):** "It sounds positively terrifying, Mr. Sterling.
You must be a genius to understand how it all works. I'd be afraid to even
touch the handle."

### Panel 2 (Page 1)

**Visual:** Close up on Diamond. She offers a shy, dimpled smile.

**Diamond:** "A girl like me? I'd probably set off an alarm just by sneezing."

**Sterling (Laughing):** "My dear, you have nothing to worry about. Beauty is
the only thing allowed free passage here."

### Panel 3 (Page 1)

**Visual:** Sterling leans in to whisper a secret, feeling superior. Diamond
listens intently, her hands clasped demurely in front of her.

**Sterling:** "Besides, the sensors are calibrated to aggression. Sudden
movements. High heart rates. The system looks for fear and greed."

### Panel 4 (Page 1)

**Visual:** Diamond sips her drink. Over the rim of the glass, her eyes aren't
smiling anymore—they are calculating, scanning the keypad behind him.

**Diamond (Internal Monologue):** "Calibrated to aggression. Good to know.
Keep the heart rate under 60. Move like water."

## PAGE 2

### Panel 1 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Later that night. The party is over. The penthouse is dark and
blue-lit.

**Caption:** 2:00 AM.

### Panel 2 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Diamond is standing in front of the vault. She hasn't changed into
a "cat burglar" suit. She is still in her elegant gown, but she has ripped the
restrictive hem off to allow movement. She is barefoot. She looks relaxed, like
she's about to do yoga.

**Diamond (Spoken):** "Okay, Mr. Genius. Let's see if you're as smart as you
think you are."

### Panel 3 (Page 2)

**Visual:** She is typing on the keypad with one hand while casually checking
her nails with the other. She looks bored.

**SFX:** Beep. Beep. Boop.

**Diamond (Internal Monologue):** "He used his birthday? God, men are
predictable. 'Educated' doesn't mean 'smart,' Sterling."

### Panel 4 (Page 2)

**Visual:** The massive vault door hisses open.

**SFX:** HISSSSSS

### Panel 5 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Inside the vault. The prize is there—a massive, glowing diamond on
a pedestal surrounded by red laser grids.

**Diamond:** "Hello, beautiful. Momma's here."

## PAGE 3

### Panel 1 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Diamond is moving through the lasers. She isn't doing frantic
flips. She is moving with the grace of a dancer—slow, fluid, precise. Her face
is calm.

**Diamond (Internal Monologue):** "He said the system detects fear. Shame I
don't have any."

### Panel 2 (Page 3)

**Visual:** She reaches the pedestal. Instead of grabbing the diamond
immediately, she pulls a small, specialized tool from her garter.

**Diamond:** "Pressure plate. 400 grams. Amateur hour."

### Panel 3 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Close up on her face as she lifts the diamond. This is the money
shot. That "mischievous" look you wanted. She is grinning—a sharp, predatory
grin.

**Diamond:** "Gotcha."

### Panel 4 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Suddenly, a red light flashes on the wall. Not an alarm, but a
camera activation.

## PAGE 4

### Panel 1 (Page 4)

**Visual:** Diamond doesn't panic. She doesn't run. She turns directly to the
camera. She instantly drops the "thief" face and switches back to the
"soft/innocent" face. She tilts her head confusingly.

**Diamond (Acting innocent):** "Oh! Mr. Sterling? Is that you? I got lost
looking for the bathroom... did I break something?"

### Panel 2 (Page 4)

**Visual:** The security feed shows "Identity Confirming..." The system is
confused by her low heart rate and sweet tone.

**Electronic Voice:** Threat Assessment: Negative. Error. User Unidentified.

### Panel 3 (Page 4)

**Visual:** While the system buffers, Diamond winks at the camera—breaking the
fourth wall. She holds the diamond up next to her face.

**Diamond (Witty/Dark):** "Don't wait up, boys. I have a date with a fence."

### Panel 4 (Page 4)

**Visual:** (The Escape) We see the back of her figure leaping off the
balcony, using a hidden grapple line attached to her pearl necklace. The vault
is empty behind her.

**Caption:** Diamond Pimpin. Always one step ahead.

## Why This Fits the Prompt

- **Polite/Educated:** She uses her manners to get the security info in Page
  1.
- **Manipulative:** She uses the "I got lost" excuse to confuse the AI
  security in Page 4.
- **Mischievous:** The wink at the camera and the internal monologue show she
  is having fun with this.
