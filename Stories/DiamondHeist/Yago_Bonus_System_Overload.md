# Yago Bonus Story: System Overload

**Perspective:** Yago (Inside the CPU)  
**Project:** Pimpire Chronicles - Platinum Edition  
**Visual Style:** TRON meets GTA - Full digital world with neon aesthetics

---

## Context

This happens simultaneously with Episode 3. Diamond has just plugged her phone into the car to hack Yago. This is what happened inside Yago's brain.

**Visual Style Change:** Unlike the realistic heist episodes, this takes place entirely inside the computer system. Think TRON/Matrix aesthetics - neon blue and purple data streams, floating platforms, digital avatars. Yago has a full digital body here and thinks he's a superhero.

---

## PAGE 1: The Digital King

### Panel 1 (Page 1)

**Visual:** Inside the "Pimpire Mainframe." The world is neon blue and purple data streams. Yago is standing on a floating disk. He looks cool here—wearing digital sunglasses and a glowing cape. He is conducting the data like a DJ.

**Yago:** "Traffic? Clear. Security? Tight. Firewall? Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. I am the God of this machine!"

### Panel 2 (Page 1)

**Visual:** A massive red alert siren appears in the sky. A giant plug (Diamond's phone connection) crashes through the sky like a meteor.

**System Voice:** INTRUSION DETECTED. PORT 4 ACCESSED.

### Panel 3 (Page 1)

**Visual:** Yago summons a glowing sword (that looks like a ban hammer).

**Yago:** "Intruder? On my watch? Oh, hell no. Prepare for the Ban Hammer!"

### Panel 4 (Page 1)

**Visual:** The smoke clears. The "Intruder" isn't a monster. It's a giant, beautiful, glowing avatar of Diamond. She looks like a digital goddess. She blows a kiss.

**Diamond (Digital Avatar):** "Hey, cutie. Is this seat taken?"

---

## PAGE 2: The Trojan Horse

### Panel 1 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Yago drops his sword. His jaw drops. His sunglasses slide down his nose.

**Yago:** "Uh... um... strictly speaking, this is a restricted sector... but I can make an exception for a VIP."

### Panel 2 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Diamond's avatar holds out a glowing pink object. It looks like a delicious donut, but it's labeled "MALWARE COOKIE."

**Diamond (Digital):** "I brought you a snack. You look tired from all that guarding."

### Panel 3 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Yago reaches for it. A little "conscience" version of Yago (like a tiny angel) appears on his shoulder.

**Tiny Angel Yago:** "Don't eat the cookie, bro! It's a Trojan! It's a trap!"

**Real Yago:** "Shut up, man. She called me cutie. I'm hungry."

### Panel 4 (Page 2)

**Visual:** Yago takes a bite of the cookie.

**SFX:** CRUNCH.

---

## PAGE 3: The Crash

### Panel 1 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Yago's eyes turn into spinning pinwheels (the "Buffering" symbol). His body starts to inflate like a balloon.

**Yago:** "This... tastes like... admin privileges... and... betrayal."

### Panel 2 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Diamond's avatar winks and dissolves into code that flows past him, unlocking the car ignition in the background.

**Diamond (Digital):** "Thanks for the ride, sugar."

### Panel 3 (Page 3)

**Visual:** Yago explodes into a pile of pixels.

**SFX:** GLITCH! ZAP! POW!

### Panel 4 (Page 3)

**Visual:** The "Blue Screen of Death" appears, but instead of white text, it says:

**Text:** SYSTEM PWNED. YOU GOT PLAYED, SON. REBOOTING...

---

## PAGE 4: The Reboot (The Sales Pitch)

### Panel 1 (Page 4)

**Visual:** (Back to Reality) Yago wakes up on the Control Room screen. He looks dizzy, with digital band-aids on his face. King Pimpin' is leaving the room (as seen in Ep 3).

**Yago:** "What happened? Did we win?"

### Panel 2 (Page 4)

**Visual:** Yago looks directly at the reader (breaking the 4th wall). He looks desperate.

**Yago:** "Yo! User! Don't look at me like that! She cheated! She used pheromones on my motherboard!"

### Panel 3 (Page 4)

**Visual:** Yago holds up a tin cup.

**Yago:** "I need an upgrade. My antivirus is from 2010. Help a brother out."

### Panel 4 (Page 4)

**Visual:** A flashy button appears on the comic page itself.

**Button Text:** DONATE COINS TO UPGRADE YAGO'S FIREWALL?

**Yago:** "Come on, toss me a coin! Next time I promise I won't eat the cookie!"

**Caption:** END OF BONUS STORY. Reward: 500 PIMPIRE COINS ADDED TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

## Why This is "Platinum" Content

### Visual Spectacle

It takes place in a totally different "world" (The Matrix/TRON style), offering a fresh look compared to the realistic heist episodes. Neon aesthetics, floating platforms, digital avatars - completely different art style.

### Humor

It turns the tense hacking scene from Episode 3 into a funny joke about Yago getting seduced by a "cookie." Shows the same event from a comedic angle.

### Direct Gamification

Page 4 literally asks the user for coins, integrating the story directly into the app's economy. Fourth-wall breaking creates engagement.

### Character Development

Shows Yago isn't just a villain - he's a lovable, overconfident AI who got outsmarted. Makes readers sympathize with him and want to help him upgrade.
